        you raise any complaint on any Merchant accessed using our Platform, we
        shall assist you to the best of our abilities by providing relevant

        Order to which the complaint relates, to enable satisfactory resolution
        of the complaint.

        communication with PDP and does not provide any pick-up and delivery
        services or Task completion services with respect to the Orders placed
        by Merchants/Buyers on the Platform as it is merely facilitating
        Delivery Services by connecting the Merchants/Buyers with the PDP
        through the Platform. In case of complaints by the Merchants/Buyers for
        deficiency or lapse in the delivery services or Task completion services
        provided by PDP, Swiggy shall notify the same to the PDP and also assist
